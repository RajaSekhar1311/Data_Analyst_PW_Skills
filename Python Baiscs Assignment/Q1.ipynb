Its ease of readability and layout enables developers to write and understand code more effectively.\n","\n","**Free and open source:** Python is freely available for use and even distribution for commercial purposes. Its open nature means that the source code is openly accessible, allowing the community to contribute and improve.\n","\n","**Extensive standard library:** Python provides a large standard library of modules and packages for various tasks, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning thus reducing the need to write code from scratch.\n","\n","**Cross-platform compatibility:** Python is a portable language, which means that code written on one operating system can run without modification on another. This makes it a versatile option for developers working in different environments.\n","\n","**Object-Oriented and Procedural Programming:** Python supports object-oriented and procedural programming paradigms, which allow flexibility in how developers organize their code.\n","\n","**Dynamically typed:** Python is dynamically typed, which means that different variables are defined at runtime. This allows greater flexibility and reduces the amount of boilerplate code.\n","\n","**Interpreted language :** Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line by line. This simplifies debugging and allows for faster development and testing.\n","\n","**Extensive community support:** Python has a large and active community, which means developers have access to many resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries. Community support also ensures that the issues remain calm.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7VQGFIjtDbpp"}}]}
